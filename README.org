Supplementary data for our manuscripts “Endogenous virophages populate the
genomes of a marine heterotrophic flagellate” describing EMALEs - endogenous
mavius-like elements - likely involved in the defense of their host against
giant virus predation.

=emales/= - nucleotide sequences;  gene, TIR (terminal inverted repeat) and
Ngaro annotations for EMALEs; EMALE locations in Cafeteria genomes.

=ngaros/= - nucletide sequences of Ngaro retrotransposons; Ngaro locations in
Cafeteria genomes.

=phylogeny/= - Multiple sequence alignments of core genes and other genes of
interest and the phylogenetic trees reconstructed from those alignments
